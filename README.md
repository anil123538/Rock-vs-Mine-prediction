# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction


This repository contains a project that predicts whether a sonar signal corresponds to a Rock or a Mine using machine learning. The project demonstrates a practical application of binary classification, combining a trained logistic regression model and an interactive web application built with Streamlit.

Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:
1. Machine Learning Backend:

Prepares input features for the model.

Trains a Logistic Regression model for binary classification.

Validates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.

2. Interactive Web Application:

Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input sonar data and view classification results.

Built with Streamlit for a dynamic and responsive experience.

Features

Backend:

Input Preparation:

Ensures input compatibility with the model's required feature set.

Scales numerical inputs using MinMaxScaler to enhance prediction accuracy.

Classification:

Computes prediction probabilities using the trained logistic regression model.

Dynamically classifies input as either a Rock or a Mine.

Model Training:

Trains a logistic regression model using the Sonar Dataset.

Validates performance to ensure reliable predictions.

Frontend:

User Inputs:

Accepts sonar signal attributes as comma-separated values (60 numerical inputs).

Interactive Features:

"Predict" button to process inputs and display classification results.

Shows prediction results alongside relevant images (rock or mine).

Streamlit Design:

Implements a responsive and visually appealing interface.

Installation and Usage

Prerequisites:

Ensure the following are installed:

Python 3.8+

Required Python packages:

streamlit
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

Steps to Run the Application:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the application:

streamlit run app.py

Interact with the app:

Enter sonar signal data (exactly 60 numerical values, comma-separated).

Click "Predict" to view results.

Dataset

The project uses the Sonar Dataset, which contains numerical features representing sonar signals. Each instance is labeled as either a Rock (R) or a Mine (M), making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

Application Details

User Interface:

Input Form:

Accepts sonar data as a single input string of 60 comma-separated numerical values.

Output:

Displays whether the signal is a Rock or a Mine.

Shows an accompanying image for the prediction result.

Prediction Logic:

Ensures the input data is properly formatted.

Leverages the trained logistic regression model to make predictions.

Handles errors gracefully, such as incorrect input format or missing values.

Future Enhancements

Implementing advanced machine learning models like Random Forests or Support Vector Machines to improve accuracy.

Adding visualization tools to explain the modelâ€™s decision-making process.

Enhancing the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.
